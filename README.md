# Football Analysis

This project focuses on **multi-criteria analysis of football team behavior** in top-level leagues.  
The main objective is to identify patterns and characteristics of teams that can be used to make smarter predictions, particularly in the context of betting strategies such as **draw progression**.

---

## Goals

- Analyze the behavior of football teams across multiple dimensions  
- Identify features that distinguish teams with higher or lower tendencies towards draws  
- Explore data-driven methods to support more informed decision-making in predicting match outcomes  

---

## Approach

- Collect and preprocess match data from top football leagues  
- Apply multi-criteria analysis to evaluate team performance and tendencies  
- Search for patterns in draw occurrence to build a basis for predictive strategies  

---

## Use Cases

- Sports analytics and team behavior research  
- Developing predictive models for match outcomes  
- Exploring data-driven approaches to betting strategies  

---

## Technologies

- Python – data processing and analysis  
- Pandas / NumPy – data manipulation  
- Matplotlib – visualization of patterns and results  

---

## Project Status

This is an exploratory academic project aimed at combining **sports knowledge** with **data analysis methods**.  
Further improvements may include:  
- Machine learning models for predictive accuracy  
- Expanded dataset with more leagues and seasons  
- Advanced statistical methods to refine draw prediction strategies
